A Marketplace is a contract where you can buy and sell NFTs, such as OpenSea or Rarible.

The Marketplace contract allows users to list NFTs for direct sale or auction. Other users can place offers/bids or buy the NFTs for the specified amount in the listing.

The marketplace can be configured to only allow certain users to list NFTs for sale, or allow any user to list NFTs for sale.
